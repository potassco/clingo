Gringo is a grounder that, given an input program with first-order variables,
computes an equivalent ground (variable-free) program. Its output can be
processed further with answer set solvers like clasp, cmodels, or smodels.

Clingo combines both gringo and clasp into a monolithic system. This way it
offers more control over the grounding and solving process than gringo and
clasp can offer individually - e.g., incremental grounding and solving.

Clingo extends the possibilities of Clingo by linear constraints over Integers.

The Python and Lua gringo modules offer the functionality of clingo in the
respective scripting language.

Reify is a small utility that reifies logic programs given in smodels format.
It produces a set of facts, which can be processed further with gringo.

Lpconvert is a converter between intermediate and smodels format.
