Gringo is a grounder that, given an input program with first-order variables,
computes an equivalent ground (variable-free) program. Its output can be
processed further with answer set solvers like clasp, cmodels, or smodels.

Clingo combines both gringo and clasp into a monolithic system. This way it
offers more control over the grounding and solving process than gringo and
clasp can offer individually - e.g., incremental grounding and solving.

The Python and Lua gringo modules offer the functionality of clingo in the
respective scripting language.

Reify is a small utility that reifies logic programs given in smodels format.
It produces a set of facts, which can be processed further with gringo.
