1 Prerequisites
---------------

Boost (>= v1.37) - http://www.boost.org/
cmake (>= v2.6)  - http://www.cmake.org/

1.1 Optional Components
-----------------------
re2c          - http://re2c.org/
SQLite (v3.x) - http://www.sqlite.org/
MySQL         - http://www.mysql.com/
Lua    (v5.1) - http://www.lua.org/

Note that the lexer generatror re2c is only needed for the svn version 
Furthermore, the project ships with a lua library. But it is also possible
to use a lua library provided by the system.

2 Compilation
-------------

If all prerequisites are satisfied and you are running a *nix, compilation
should be as simple as typing:
	make

If you want to use a boost library that is not installed in a default 
location than you can specify its location using environtment variables:

BOOST_ROOT       - The preferred installation prefix for searching for Boost.
                   Set this if the module has problems finding the proper
                   Boost installation.

BOOST_INCLUDEDIR - Similar to BOOST_ROOT but sets the path to the include 
                   directory directly.

BOOST_LIBRARYDIR - Similar to BOOST_ROOT but sets the path to the library
                   directory directly.

To use a Boost installation in /usr/local, you should compile the project 
using:
	BOOST_ROOT=/usr/local make

2.1 Notes for Mac Users
-----------------------

You should install the macports version of boost and remove the no_single
variant. If you want to share the binary with others, you might additionally
want to enable universal and disable no_static. Depending on the variants you
selected, options to cmake could look like this:
	-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-Wall -arch i386 -arch x86_64"
	-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release
	-DBoost_USE_STATIC_LIBS=true

2.2 Customization
-----------------
Additional options might be specified to cmake. To get an overview use
for example cmake-gui or take a look at the main cmake file.

4 Installation
--------------

If compilation succeeded, the respective build folder will contain a bin
folder with an executable, which should be copied somewhere into your path.
