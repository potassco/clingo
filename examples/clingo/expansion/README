The script in main.py gradually expands logic programs structured into the parts:

- base         : rules instantiated initially
- object(m,k)  : rules instantiated when an m-th object is introduced at step k
- horizon(n,k) : rules instantiated when the horizon is turned up to n at step k
- expand(k)    : rules instantiated along with object(m,k)/horizon(n,k) at step k

For example, in GraphColouring (see GraphColouring/encodings/encoding.lp) objects
correspond to nodes of a graph and the horizon is given by colors. Both nodes and
colors are labeled by consecutive integers starting from 1, the parts object(m,k)
and horizon(n,k) specify auxiliary predicates controlling the instances of rules
in expand(k) that will be generated at step k, and the base part consists of the
facts of an instance. Then, main.py takes care of expanding objects (nodes), as
long as there is any, and extending the number of colors on demand, whenever an
unsatisfiable problem is encountered. The two major operation modes of main.py
are multi-shot solving or repeated single-shot solving (via option --scratch).
For a summary of all options, run:

./main.py

The script main.py requires the gringo Python library shipped with clingo (see
http://potassco.sourceforge.net).
