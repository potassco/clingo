This example shows how to use the enumeration assumption. Note that calls to
solve are only repeatable if this assumption is enabled. If it is disabled, an
(implementation dependent) subset of the clauses learnt during enumeration of
solutions is kept.

Example calls:
  clingo example-py.lp
  clingo example-lua.lp
