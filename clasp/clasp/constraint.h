 * Post propagators are called after unit propagation on each decision level and

 *
 * They extend a solver's unit-propagation with more elaborate propagation mechanisms.
 * The typical asp example is an unfounded set check.
 *
 * \note Currently, the solver distinguishes \b two classes of post propagators:
 *       - class_simple: deterministic post propagators that only extend
 *         the current decision level. That is, these post propagators shall neither
 *         backtrack below the current decision level nor permanently add new decision levels.
 *         Deterministic post propagators are called in priority order. For this,
 *         the function PostPropagator::priority() is used and shall return a priority in the range: <tt>[priority_class_simple, priority_class_general)</tt>
 *       - class_general: post propagators that are non-deterministic or those that are not limited to extending
 *         the current decision level shall have a priority of priority_class_general. They are called in FIFO order
 *         after \b all simple post propagators have reached a fixpoint.
 *
 * \note There are currently three reserved priority values, namely
 *  - priority_reserved_msg for message and termination handler (if any),
 *  - priority_reserved_ufs for the default unfounded set checker (if any),
 *  - and priority_reserved_look for the default lookahead operator (if any).
