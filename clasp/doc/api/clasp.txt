clasp - the <b>c</b>onflict-driven <b>l</b>earning <b>a</b>nswer <b>s</b>et <b>p</b>rogramming system -
is an answer set solver for (extended) normal and disjunctive logic programs. It combines the high-level modeling capacities
of answer set programming (ASP) with state-of-the-art techniques from the area of Boolean constraint solving.
The primary clasp algorithm relies on conflict-driven nogood learning,
a technique that proved very successful for satisfiability checking (SAT).

clasp can be applied as an ASP, (Max-)SAT, or PB solver, or as a C++ library in another program.
It provides different reasoning modes and advanced features from Boolean
constraint solving including:
  - Enumeration of (Projected) Solutions
  - Optimization of Solutions
  - Cautious and Brave Reasoning
  - Parallel (multithreaded) solving
  - ASP/SAT/PB modulo acyclicity
  .
